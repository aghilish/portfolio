Summary
I build Kubernetes platforms for large enterprises and help teams actually
ship software on them. 16 years in, I've gone from writing backend code to
architecting cloud infrastructure for companies like VW, Audi, Commerzbank,
and Google Cloud partners.

Right now I lead DevOps workstreams at Deloitte, where I run a team of 12
and build the platform that VW's factory software runs on. Before that, I
migrated Commerzbank's microservices to multi-regional Anthos and built
their KYC data pipeline. I also did a short stint at CARIAD moving their
infotainment build system to GitHub Enterprise.

I hold CKA, CKS, and Google Cloud Professional Architect certifications.
I organize Cloud Native Frankfurt, a CNCF community group. I make
Kubernetes tutorials on YouTube and interactive labs on KillerCoda because
I think this stuff should be easier to learn than it is.
Experience
Deloitte Consulting
2 years
DevOps Squad Lead

Leading two workstreams for Volkswagen's factory software platform (ART
FSS). Team of 12: 6 Consultants, 3 Senior Consultants, 3 additional

Technical lead and platform engineer for the DevOps Enabling Team. Built
a self-service CDK library that meets VW's AWS Vanguard compliance
requirements. Teams use it to provision infrastructure without filing tickets.

Set up CI/CD on EKS with reusable deployment patterns. Designed the
ART-wide observability strategy: metrics, logs, traces, business KPIs. Stack
is OpenTelemetry plus Elastic. Built zero-code instrumentation through shared
NuGet packages so application teams get monitoring without changing their
code. Extended Helm charts to support OTLP exporters.
